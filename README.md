My first proper website for a small car hire business
-----------------------------------------------------
This is just a simple repository that entails all the files that is used in the website www.kingdomhire.com

This repository is public to allow you to see the source code, and any changes I will make to the project. I am aiming to extend the website to include JavaScript, PHP etc.

# 19/02/2017 Update

Will be looking into continuing development on the webite within the next few weeks if possible, currently learning some new technologies that I want to deploy on the website, such as Bootstrap, JQuery, AngularJS and JSON (Learnt that I can't add database functionality as originally planned due to the website hosting service not providing it).

Because of this, I will need to re-design the entire website from scratch to accompany a new Bootstrap layout and new features, such as a tabbed pane that groups different vehicle types together to allow the user to find the types of vehicles they are looking for, more vehicles in general (from 6 currently on the site, to around 15+), a reservation form, business opening hours, a price list and some other possible features that I am thinking about including, but may not make it into the final product.

So anyway that's a little update about how this project is going so far and what I am planning on doing in the future, thanks for reading!
